### `🧱 bs.block`

- <abbr title="Breaking Changes">⚠️</abbr> **[#509](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/bookshelf/issues/509)** - Removed multi-tick fill operations (`fill_block`, `fill_type`, `fill_random`). Use the new `bs.generation` module for async iteration with callbacks.
- <abbr title="Breaking Changes">⚠️</abbr> **[#523](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/bookshelf/issues/523)** - Removed deprecated functions and tags from previous versions.
- <abbr title="Breaking Changes">⚠️</abbr> **[#525](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/bookshelf/issues/525)** - Removed NBT concatenation from block output. State and NBT are now returned as separate fields.
- <abbr title="Enhancements">⚡</abbr> **[#509](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/bookshelf/issues/509)** - Simplified `fill_block` to use the vanilla `fill` command (single-tick execution).
- <abbr title="Enhancements">⚡</abbr> **[#509](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/bookshelf/issues/509)** - Simplified `fill_type` with a cleaner recursion model (single-tick execution).

- <abbr title="New Features">✨</abbr> **[#509](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/bookshelf/issues/509)** - Added `on_cuboid` for 3D iteration over a cubic region with configurable direction, spacing, and tick limit.
- <abbr title="New Features">✨</abbr> **[#509](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/bookshelf/issues/509)** - Added `on_rectangle` for 2D iteration over a rectangular region with configurable direction, spacing, and tick limit.

- <abbr title="Bug Fix">🐛</abbr> **[#435](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/bookshelf/issues/435)** - Configurable iteration direction now allows accommodating mask offsets when blocks are updated during iteration.
