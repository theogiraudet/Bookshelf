### Get Biome

```{function} #bs.environment:get_biome

Get biome data at the execution position of the function.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `at <entity>` or `positioned <x> <y> <z>`**: Position from which you want to get biome data.

:Outputs:
  **Storage `bs:out environment.get_biome`**:
  :::{treeview}
  - {nbt}`compound` Biome data
    - {nbt}`string` **type**: String representation of the biome ID (e.g., `minecraft:plains`).
    - {nbt}`double` **temperature**: The base temperature of the biome.
    - {nbt}`bool` **has_precipitation**: Whether the biome has precipitation or not.
  :::
```

*Example: Get biome data at the current location:*

```mcfunction
# Once
function #bs.environment:get_biome
data get storage bs:out environment.get_biome

### Get Temperature

```{function} #bs.environment:get_temperature {scale:<scaling>}

Get the temperature at the execution position of the function, taking the altitude into account.

:Inputs:
  **Execution `at <entity>` or `positioned <x> <y> <z>`**: Position from which you want to get the temperature.

  **Function macro**:
  :::{treeview}
  - {nbt}`compound` Arguments
    - {nbt}`number` **scale**: Scalar for the function's output.
  :::

:Outputs:
  **Return | Score `$environment.get_temperature bs.out`**: Temperature at the given position.
```

*Example: Get the temperature at the current altitude:*

```mcfunction
# Once
function #bs.environment:get_temperature {scale:1000}
```
