# 🔄 Finite State Machine

**`#bs.fsm:help`**

A powerful Finite State Machine (FSM) system for managing complex state-based behaviors in Minecraft.

```{epigraph}
FSMs are without a doubt the most commonly used technology in game AI programming today. 
They are conceptually simple, efficient, easily extensible, and yet powerful enough to handle a wide variety of situations.

-- Daniel D. Fu & Ryan Houlette
```

The FSM module provides a comprehensive system for creating, managing, and executing finite state machines. 
It allows you to define states, transitions, and behaviors in a declarative way, making complex state management simple and maintainable.

## 📦 Templates

A state machine is described by a **template**: a plain NBT compound that you store wherever you want, with vanilla commands.
Since a template is just data, you can write it once on load, or build and edit it at runtime, and you choose how to namespace it.

:::{treeview}
- {nbt}`compound` Template
  - {nbt}`string` **initial**: Name of the initial state (must exist in states array).
  - {nbt}`string` **on_cancel**: Command to run when the machine is cancelled (optional).
  - {nbt}`list` **states**: Array of state definitions.
    - {nbt}`compound` State
      - {nbt}`string` **name**: Unique name for the state.
      - {nbt}`string` **on_tick**: Command to run every tick while in this state (optional).
      - {nbt}`string` **on_enter**: Command to run when entering this state (optional).
      - {nbt}`string` **on_exit**: Command to run when exiting this state (optional).
      - {nbt}`bool` **final**: Whether this state is a final state (optional, default: false).
      - {nbt}`list` **transitions**: Array of transition definitions (optional).
        - {nbt}`compound` Transition
          - {nbt}`string` **name**: Name of the transition (optional).
          - {nbt}`string` {nbt}`compound` **condition**: Transition condition. One of the following:
            - {nbt}`string` Manual transition: the literal `"manual"`, triggered by the `#bs.fsm:emit` feature.
            - {nbt}`compound` Predicate-based transition.
              - {nbt}`string` **type**: Must be "predicate".
              - {nbt}`string` **wait**: Predicate to check to trigger the transition.
            - {nbt}`compound` Command-based transition.
              - {nbt}`string` **type**: Must be "command".
              - {nbt}`string` **wait**: Command to check to trigger the transition.
            - {nbt}`compound` Hook-based transition.
              - {nbt}`string` **type**: Must be "hook".
              - {nbt}`string` **wait**: Hook function to evaluate.
            - {nbt}`compound` Time-based transition.
              - {nbt}`string` **type**: Must be "delay".
              - {nbt}`int` **wait**: Time delay in ticks.
          - {nbt}`string` **to**: Name of the target state (must exist in states array).

*Example: store a light template, then validate it:*

```mcfunction
# Store the template wherever you want
data modify storage my_pack:fsm light set value { \
  initial: "off", \
  states: [ \
    { \
      name: "off", \
      on_enter: "setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:redstone_lamp", \
      transitions: [{ name: "turn_on", condition: "manual", to: "on" }] \
    }, \
    { \
      name: "on", \
      on_enter: "setblock ~ ~ ~ minecraft:redstone_lamp[lit=true]", \
      final: true \
    } \
  ] \
}

# Check it once, before running it
function #bs.fsm:validate { uses: "my_pack:fsm light" }
```

Since the template is yours, you delete it like any other data:

```mcfunction
data remove storage my_pack:fsm light
```

## 🔧 Functions

You can find below all functions available in this module.

---

### Validate

```{function} #bs.fsm:validate

Check that a template describes a valid state machine, and report every problem found through the log module.

:Inputs:
  **Function macro**:
  :::{treeview}
  - {nbt}`compound` Arguments
    - {nbt}`string` **uses**: Storage source of the template, as `<namespace>:<storage> <path>`.
  :::

:Outputs:
  **Return**: Success (1) if the template is valid, failure (0) otherwise.
```

*Example: validate a template:*

```mcfunction
function #bs.fsm:validate { uses: "my_pack:fsm light" }
```

Running machines are never validated: this is up to you.
Validate a static template once on load, and a dynamic one every time you are done editing it.

  **State**: The machines run on the executing entities, starting in their initial state.
```

*Example: run a light machine bound to an entity:*

```mcfunction
execute as @n[type=zombie] run function #bs.fsm:init_as { name: "entity_light", uses: "my_pack:fsm light" }

# The light machine is now running on this zombie and has entered its initial state
```

## ❓ What is a FSM?

A Finite State Machine (FSM) is a conceptual model used to describe how a system behaves in response to events. 
It defines a limited set of possible states that the system can be in at any given moment. 
The system starts in an initial state and, when something happens, such as receiving an input or a signal, it may change its state following predefined rules. 
These changes are called transitions, and each one depends on the current state and the event received.

What makes FSMs powerful is their simplicity and clarity. 
By reducing a system's behavior to a set of states and transitions, we can describe even complex logic in a very structured and predictable way. 
At any point in time, the system is in exactly one state, and the logic for moving between states is well defined. 
This helps avoid ambiguity and makes it easier to understand how the system reacts to different situations.

In Minecraft, Finite State Machines can be particularly useful to manage tree dialog, boss phases, or any system state.
Outside Minecraft, Finite State Machines are widely used in many fields because they provide a clean way to manage systems that have different modes or stages. 
In software development, they are useful for designing user interfaces, game character behavior, communication protocols, and more. 
In hardware and control systems, they are often used to manage sequences of operations or reactions to sensor inputs. 
Overall, FSMs are a fundamental tool for modeling reactive systems in a way that is both rigorous and easy to reason about.

## 💡 Example in Minecraft

```{mermaid}
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Idle

    Idle --> Alert : if player detected

    Alert --> Attack : after 5s AND player still detected
    Alert --> Idle : after 5s AND player gone

    Attack --> Searching : if player lost

    Searching --> Attack : if player found
    Searching --> Idle : after 10s AND player not found

    Attack --> Idle : if player defeated
```

This finite state machine controls the behavior of a custom mob in Minecraft: a sentinel that guards a specific area. 
It begins in the **Idle** state, where it stays mostly still, occasionally performing small ambient animations. 
When a player enters its detection radius, as determined by a custom command or predicate, the FSM transitions to the **Alert** state.
In the **Alert** state, the sentinel visually or audibly signals that it has detected an intruder. 
This state is time-based, lasting about five seconds. 
If the player is still present when this period ends, the sentinel moves to the **Attack** state.
During **Attack**, the mob actively pursues and attacks the player. 
If the player escapes or is no longer detectable, the FSM transitions to the **Searching** state. 
There, the sentinel wanders the area near the last known location of the intruder for a set amount of time.
If it finds the player again during this search, it returns to **Attack**. 
Otherwise, if the timer runs out without detecting anyone, it returns to the **Idle** state and resumes its guard duty.
If the player is defeated, the FSM transitions to the **Idle** state and resumes its guard duty.

## 📋 Validation Rules

The FSM system enforces several validation rules to ensure proper operation:

### Initiality
- The FSM must have an `initial` state specified
- The initial state must exist in the states array

### Unicity
- All state names must be unique within the FSM
- All transition names must be unique within a state (if specified)

### Acceptability
- The FSM must have at least one final state
- Final states are states marked with `final: true`

### Reachability
- All final states must be reachable from the initial state
- This is determined by analyzing the transition graph

### Transition Validation
- All transition target states must exist in the states array
- Transition conditions must be valid according to their type

---

## 🔄 State Lifecycle

Each state in an FSM follows a specific lifecycle:

1. **Enter**: The `on_enter` function is called when entering the state
2. **Tick**: The `on_tick` function is called every tick while in the state
3. **Transition evaluation**: When a transition condition is met, the state transitions
4. **Exit**: The `on_exit` function is called when leaving the state

---

## ⚡ Transition Types

The FSM system supports several types of transitions:

### Manual
Triggered by external function calls. 
Useful for player interactions or external events.

### Predicate
Triggered when a predicate returns true. 
Useful for conditional logic.

### Command
Triggered when a command succeeds. 
Useful for complex conditions.

### Hook
Triggered by hook system events. 
Useful for integration with other systems.

### Delay
Triggered after a specified time delay. 
Useful for timed behaviors.

---

## ⚠️ Best Practices

1. **Keep states focused**: Each state should represent a single, well-defined behavior
2. **Use meaningful names**: State and transition names should clearly describe their purpose
3. **Handle edge cases**: Always consider what happens when transitions fail
4. **Clean up resources**: Use the on_exit functions to clean up state-specific resources
5. **Define a cancel command**: Use a `on_cancel` command to clean up resources when the FSM is cancelled
