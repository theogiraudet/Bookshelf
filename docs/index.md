# Bookshelf Library

<p style="max-width: 38rem">
Bookshelf is a library datapack for Minecraft. It's modular, so mapmakers can pick only the parts they need. This helps them create complex systems more easily.

## 🔥 Motivation

Libraries save time and make systems easier to create. But many Minecraft mapmakers aren't used to them. Bookshelf exists to change that.
Bookshelf focuses on ease of use. Each module is simple, works for any skill level, and keeps performance in mind.
