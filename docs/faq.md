# 📋 FAQ

## Can anyone use Bookshelf?

Anyone can use Bookshelf in a project. If you can, a mention of Bookshelf is always welcome as it helps keep the open source world a respectful place. You can also share your projects on the [Discord](https://discord.gg/MkXytNjmBt) server. This shows others how you use Bookshelf and helps keep the community active.

## Is it compatible with other datapacks?

Yes. Bookshelf follows strict rules to stay compatible with other datapacks. All scores, tags, and resources use namespaces and follow Smithed conventions.

## Is it resource-heavy?

### 🧠 CPU usage

Bookshelf is mainly a set of functions that only run when you use them. They don't affect CPU on their own. Their impact depends on how complex the function is and how often you run it.

### 💾 Memory usage

Minecraft loads datapacks at startup, so file count has little effect on memory use. Instructions are lightweight, and you can include many functions without increasing RAM needs. Bookshelf's modular design also lets you load only the modules you need.

### 💽 Disk usage

Bookshelf comes as compressed zip datapacks. If size matters, use the [Bookshelf Manager](https://mcbookshelf.dev) to download a bundle and pick only the modules you need.

## Are the functions optimized?

Yes, optimization is a key focus, but Bookshelf aims to be easy to use and flexible. Some design choices may not be fully optimal because of this.

## What about copyrights?

You can use Bookshelf in any map or datapack. You can modify it, share your changes, or use it in commercial projects. But modified files must keep the same license. That's why Bookshelf uses the [MPL 2.0](https://github.com/mcbookshelf/bookshelf/blob/master/LICENSE) license.
