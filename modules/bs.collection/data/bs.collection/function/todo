-[x] early return in almost all entry points
-[x] have a call function for each feature to have more cache
-[x] max and min (no scale use int only)
-[-] some features dont need the stack, also we could reverse recurse in some functions that are not of ordre superieur
-[ ] in some stack like map consumed can be changed to an incremented value
-[x] all_rec and any_rec: no need for last execute if score #s bs.ctx matches 1 
-[-] average (scaling for the output no need for the stack, do not use count feature and directly store in score)
-[x] count: could be done with a single command
-[x] find: early return return fail up
-[x] findrec and find_last_rec:
  -[x] comment # If the recursive function succeeded, set the result and return
  -[x] execute if score #s bs.ctx matches 1 run return 0 (use an other return run function instead o 3 checks)
  -[x] last return not needed
